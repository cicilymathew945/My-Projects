# Algorithmic Marketing Projects
This repository showcases a collection of data-driven marketing projects where I apply machine learning and statistical algorithms to solve real-world marketing challenges. Each project explores how algorithms can enhance marketing decision-making, customer insights, and personalization.

🔍 Key Areas Covered

Customer Segmentation & Clustering: Using algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering to group customers based on behavior, demographics, and purchase patterns.

Recommendation Systems: Building collaborative and content-based recommendation models to personalize product or content suggestions.

Conjoint Analysis: Applying conjoint and choice modeling to understand customer preferences and estimate the value of different product features.

Predictive Modeling: Forecasting customer churn, campaign success, and lifetime value using supervised learning methods.

Market Basket Analysis: Discovering product affinities and cross-sell opportunities using association rule mining (Apriori, FP-Growth).

🧩 Tech Stack

Languages: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, statsmodels)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Modeling & Analysis: scikit-learn, XGBoost, Surprise, PyMC, SciPy

Data Sources: Synthetic and real-world marketing datasets
